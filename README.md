Endnote Processor
---

This application is used by the editors of the University of Illinois Law Review to extract sources from Microsoft Word (Office Open XML) documents in preparation for bookpull and cite-check.

The endnotes are extracted from the document. The user then has the option to break up endnotes that contain multiple sources, and to mark each one as being in one of six different categories (Book, Case, Journal, Legislative, Periodical, or Miscellaneous), or to mark the endnotes as not containing a source citation. The sources are then exported to CSV for import into our electronic bookpull system.

This software is designed for the University of Illinois Law Review, but others may find it useful. Feel free to open issues on Github for any bugs or ideas for enhancement.
